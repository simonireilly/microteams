# Infrastructure

Infrastructure stems from shared account concerns like VPC networking and DNS.

This type of thing needs often to be configured once per account, to reduce costs for things such as NAT gateway.

## Responsibilities

- Deploy infrastructure via the AWS CDK.
- Provide cross stack exports for any dependencies.
